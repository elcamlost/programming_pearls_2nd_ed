# programming_pearls_2nd_ed
John Bentley's Programming Pearls is one of the most influential books in software engineering. 
I just started to read it and to get most benefit, I want to solve all problems in Perl (Pearls in Perl, yeah).

Quick github search with query "Programming Pearls Perl" returned zero results (and more than hundred results without language specification), so I feel myself a bit like a pioneer.

I'm very bad in task estimating, but I want to solve all problems to December 
(one column a week).
