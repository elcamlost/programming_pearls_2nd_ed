##Problem Definition
One barrier between the code sketch and a complete FORTRAN program is the implementation of bitmaps. While this would be trivial in programming languages that support bitmaps as a primitive data type, FORTRAN programmers must usually implement them using other oerations. Suppose tha the FORTRAN dialect provided bitwise logical operations on words (such as shifting, ANDing and ORing); how would you advise the programmers to implement bit vectors? How could you implement bitmaps if those logical operations were not available? How would you implement algorithm in COBOL? In Pascal?
